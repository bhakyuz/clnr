# clnr
clnr is the collection of experiments for a complete R package in order to clean character vectors by clustering and merging similar ones. 

Inspired quite much from [open refine](http://openrefine.org/) project but aims to generalize and make cleaning tasks more reproducible. That being said, other types of data should be able to clean as well. 
Look at [refinr](https://github.com/ChrisMuir/refinr) package for only automated string cleaning 

## Things to come:
- [ ] Build initial version with simple functionality
- [ ] Create more fingerprint functions
- [ ] Ensure independency of dplyr
- [ ] Let user pass their own fingerprint functions
- [ ] Store combined texts as fingerprint functions so it can be used in the future easily for repro purpose
- [ ] Better printing while getting user feedback
- [ ] Log what has been done
- [ ] Brainstorming on Iterative vs. one shot perspective

Thanks for feedback and contribution
